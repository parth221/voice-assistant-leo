# voice-assistant-leo
We have developed a desktop voice assistant for both busy working and visually impaired individuals and people who are not comfortable using the keyboard. They can perform many daily tasks such as YouTube search, playing the music of user interest, a web search via user's voice commands. Our application also provides daily COVID-19 and stock market details to end-users.
